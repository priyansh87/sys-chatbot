    "Fight with mom: Mom is being super annoying about my clothes today. She thinks my skirt is too short and we had a huge screaming match.",
    "Bad hair day: My hair is just NOT cooperating today. It's frizzy and I look like a mess and I'm so upset about it.",
    "Spilled coffee: I spilled coffee all over my favorite white top this morning. I tried to clean it but now there's a huge stain.",
    "Boring class: I'm stuck in the most boring lecture ever. The professor is droning on and on and I'm dying of boredom.",
    "Broken nail: I just broke a nail and it hurts so much! It was my favorite manicure too. Ugh, my life is over.",
    "Lost keys: I couldn't find my keys for like 20 minutes and I was almost late. I was running around the house like a crazy person.",
    "Annoying neighbor: My neighbor is playing loud music again and it's giving me such a headache. I want to go yell at them.",
    "Online shopping regret: I bought this dress online and it arrived today and it looks TERRIBLE on me. I need to return it but I'm too lazy.",
    "Craving pizza: I have been craving pizza all day but I'm trying to be healthy. It's literally torture.",
    "Forgot to charge phone: My phone died when I was out and I felt so lost without it. I need to remember to charge it at night.",
